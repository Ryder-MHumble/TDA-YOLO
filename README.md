# TDA-YOLO
This repository contains a selection of experimental data used to validate the results presented in our TDA-YOLO modeling research paper. By storing the training and validation outputs of different YOLO-based models, these data are organized for easy access and validation of the results. In addition, we provide you with download links to the open-source datasets used in this repository.
## Abstract
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Remote Sensing Imagery (UAVRSI) is increasingly used across various industries for its effectiveness in target detection. However, traditional methods that rely on large kernels or dilated convolutions often fail to effectively capture fine-grained features, particularly in complex environments with varying object scales and densities. We introduce TDA-YOLO, an advanced adaptive detection model featuring optimized sampling and dynamic sensing head modules to address these challenges. The model includes a Lightweight Adaptive Weighted DownSampling (LAWDS) module, which adaptively prioritizes feature importance and selectively retains critical spatial information for enhanced detection accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic UpSampling (DUS) technique that combines dynamic offset generation with adaptive modulation, optimizing traditional upsampling methods and reducing computational overhead. The TDA-YOLO model also features a Deformable Dynamic Detect (TD Detect) head, utilizing dynamic offsets for non-regular sampling, thereby improving adaptability and generalization across diverse target scales and shapes. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone and DOTAv2 datasets demonstrate that TDA-YOLO significantly outperforms existing models, achieving superior precision and mAP, and confirming its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into two main directories, each containing data from different phases of model evaluation:

### 1. Screenshot of experimental data

This directory contains the results from the training phase of the models. It is subdivided into three specific subdirectories:

- **Train**: This directory is used to store screenshots of training result data for some of the models from the two open-source datasets.
- ***VisDrone***
- ***DOTAv2***
  
- **Val**: This directory is used to store screenshots of value result data for some of the models from the two open-source datasets.
- ***VisDrone***
- ***DOTAv2***
